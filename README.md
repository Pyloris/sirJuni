#### A Simple Mini-Framework for PHP Backend Development

## Quick Install with Composer
Just execute
```
composer require shoaib/sir-juni
```

# How to use
If you want to use Components from the Framework, make sure you include the `autoload.php` file from the `vendor/` directory that gets created after running the above command.

After this, you can simply use the components of the framework by using the `use sirJuni\Framework\..` below the require statement of the 'autoload.php'.
